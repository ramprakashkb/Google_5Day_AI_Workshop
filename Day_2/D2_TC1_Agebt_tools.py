 Building Custom Function Tools:
 *******************************
 Built-in tools like Google Search are powerful, but every business has unique requirements that generic tools can't handle. 
 Custom tools let you implement your specific business logic, connect to your systems, and solve domain-specific problems. 
 ADK provides multiple custom tool types to handle these scenarios
 
 
Example: Currency Converter Agent¶
This agent can convert currency from one denomination to another and calculates the fees to do the conversion. 
The agent has two custom tools and follows the workflow:

Fee Lookup Tool - Finds transaction fees for the conversion (mock)
Exchange Rate Tool - Gets currency conversion rates (mock)
Calculation Step - Calculates the total conversion cost including the fees
